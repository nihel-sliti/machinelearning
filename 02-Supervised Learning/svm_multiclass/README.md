# Multiclass SVM Example 🌐🤖

This repository demonstrates how to use **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for **multiclass classification** using the **Iris dataset**. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm typically used for binary classification, and here we explore two strategies to extend it to handle multiple classes: **One-vs-Rest (OVR)** and **One-vs-One (OVO)**.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

In this project, we:
- Load and preprocess the **Iris dataset** (3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
- Train two SVM models using **OVR** and **OVO** strategies.
- Visualize the **decision boundaries** of the models.
- Compare the **accuracy** of the two strategies.
